SCATTERING-BASED HYBRID NETWORKS: AN EVALUATION AND DESIGN GUIDE
This repository contains the source code for the experiments executed in the paper mentioned above and published in ICIP 2021.
Instructions
To run experiments first download the code, create and run a virtual environment, install the required packages (specified in requirements.txt)

Experiments
The resources available in this framework are specified in system_init/input_manager.py:

available_classifiers = ['3FC', 'simple_cnn', 'mlp', 'linear', 'wrnscat_12_32', 'wrnscat_12_16', 'wrnscat_12_8', 'wrnscat_50_2', 'wrn_16_32',
                        'wrn_16_16', 'wrn_16_8', 'wrn_16_2', 'wrn_50_2', 'wrn_50_2_torch', 'wrn_50_2_torch_pretrained','wrnscat_short_50_2']

available_scatternets = ['mallat', 'mallat_l', 'dtcwt', 'dtcwt_l']

avalable_datasets = ['mnist', 'flowers', 'tinyimagenet']
The following classifiers are compatible with scattering networks:

'wrnscat_12_32', 'wrnscat_12_16', 'wrnscat_12_8', 'wrnscat_50_2','wrnscat_short_50_2'
To run an experiment, please, use main.py with the following arguments:

-env_file ----> File that contains the enviroment setup params
-scat_file ---> File that contains the scattering setup params
-net_file ----> File that contains the dnn network setup params
-data_file ---> File that contains the dataset setup params
-output_file -> File that contains the enviroment setup params
Examples of such files could be found in experiment_setup/datasets/{dataset name} for experiments performed in the presented paper.

It is possible to combine all arguments in a single file, the full list of arguments may be found in system_init/input_manager.py::parse_input() or by typing

main.py -h
Repository Structure
Here the basic structure and logic of the repository will be outlined. Hopefully, this will help you navigate the project.

Scattering Networks
Some already existing packages with scattering networks were employed in our experiments, some of which were amended. To avoid version mismatch and other unwanted difficulties, those packages were included in the source code:

kymatio
pytorch_wavelets
scatnet_learn
System Control
Another important part of the framework is the system control which is specified in the following two folders:

system_init -----> Includes handling of datasets and networks
system_actions -> Specifies train and test loops
Experiments Support
Other directories include:

experiment_setup --> Input files used to run the exeriments
results_decoder ----> Code for interpreting the results, used to transform .json output into reports and visuals
Run File
main.py -> The application file that brings the framework together and allows the running of experiments
